<h1>Great Again</h1>
<h2>An American Fantasy by E Martin Nolan</h2> 

 
<p>An inflamed, flaking scrotum <br/>
sags from Donald Trump’s chin.<br/>
A nine-volt alkaline battery froths within.</p>

<p>The aging battery suffers from self-discharge. <br/>
Pressure built up, trying the case's integrity, <br/>
testing the strength of the steel seals. Potassium hydroxide, <br/>
known as caustic potash, conductor of the battery's power, <br/>
grew weak, leaked when the pressure became too much.</p>

<p>A corrosive white crystalline rash spreads<br/>
from the ruptured case and cracked seals,<br/>
searing the inner-skin of Trump’s chin marvel.  </p>
 
<p>This is the source of Trump’s depraved miracle: sores,<br/>
constant burning skin, the tips of fretful nerves<br/>
grown used to the offense. The battery feeds,<br/>
through a golden wire, his brain’s dopamine circuits, <br/>
stoking Trump’s mental reward system bitterly<br/>
through the memory of the battery’s faded charge.</p>
 
<p>Resentment of lost power is a feeling like power, <br/>
but it’s not power, not yet. Until then, it swells, spills.<br/>
Trump’s the bloated body of that, a corrosive attack.</p>

<p>The scrotum’s constant inner burning  <br/>
causes its frayed hairs to smoke like incense, <br/>
drawing people in to be touched <br/>
by his miraculous reclaiming <br/>
of power from dying sources. </p>  

<p>They come ruptured, variously cracked<br/>
from self-discharge. Caustic potash has busted<br/>
through their skin and white rashes spread<br/>
from the breakages.</p>

<p>They've gathered here today to proclaim <br/>
the sacredness of their scars, the mystery <br/>
of their faith in the coming restoration.  </p>

<p>Cuts across their calves and their soft belly skin. <br/>
These chosen profess: a nation’s potential energy,<br/>
all its past glories, has been ripped out of them.<br/>
It shall come again, this Earth to become a heaven.  </p>

<p>They come picking at the half-scared-over ruptures <br/>
and bleeding alabaster rashes Trump speaks into—<br/>
intercoms to the soul.</p>

<p>As his sermon ends, the whole of the congregation<br/>
forms a line to file toward him to receive, <br/>
one by damaged one, Trump’s sacrament <br/>
of laying on. They wait hours, their scars <br/>
swelling with each step toward his center.  </p>

<p>Each will see an instant vision produced by Trump, <br/>
a co-direction between he and them. <br/>
Themselves the whole rapt audience and the hero. <br/>
So much taken away. Each loss an isolated greatness <br/>
denied. Each retribution different. Huge special effects. <br/>
Trump cameos frequent. He’s very well liked.  </p>

<p>The first man in line steps up, removes his Kid Rock <br/>
hat. A white rash pulses across his forehead<br/>
from a mounded crack on his receding hairline.<br/>
He leans forward, presenting to Trump his rupture. </p>

<p>Trump lifts his head high and lays<br/>
the scaled scrotum upon the rupture.<br/>
The white mound hisses and sizzles. <br/>
Trump does not heal him. He increases<br/>
both their pains. The whole rash burns,<br/>
the scrotum burns inside and out.
Trump’s eyes grow wide, go all milk-white. </p>

<p>Then Trump stiffens, stills. His hair springs straight up, <br/>
vibrates, making a faint high-C note that fills the air. </p>

<p>His devotee closes his eyes, grits his teeth.<br/>
Then the pain stops—they are joined.<br/>
Trump’s miracle enters him, igniting<br/>
a personal vision of greatness regained—</p>

<img src="images/4.jpg" class="illustration">

<p>jets flying over red and white bars,<br/>
rockets that explode into stars,<br/>
eagles soaring, gas pouring—what we are: </p>

<p>a middle linebacker, his head like a battering ram, <br/>
Seal Team 6, dealing death to a Saudi imam, <br/>
a Hummer crushing a Prius in a traffic jam.</p>

<p>Trump in priestly robes and a general's hat, <br/>
pimp-smacks the world from round back to flat.<br/>
Weak hippies wince, don't know how to react.</p>

<p>He proclaims us rulers of seas, protectors of good, <br/>
we're in charge, drop a nuke? Don’t doubt he would.<br/>
For us to have all this, our God died up on that wood,</p>

<p>but we lost that strength, brought down by our weak<br/>
who tricked us into thinking we had to let them speak.<br/>
Bogged down in their talking, grew soft like baby cheeks.</p>

<p>With Trump we rise again to face the crisis<br/>
of Obama's climate science-funded alliance with Isis.<br/>
Down with crazy Bernie and crooked Hillary, the heartless,</p>
 
<p>screw Marco, screw Jeb, Ted Cruz is double-foreign,<br/>
a Cuban-Canuck betting on lame dog-whistle chagrin,<br/>
teamed with Carly, a two, how ugly? Can’t begin…</p>

<p>Let this hot scene burn on the screen of your mind, <br/>
fade to a cool blue light-show of paradise defined,<br/>
won’t ever stop digging Trump’s dope ego sublime.</p>

<p>Trump lifts his chin from the man’s forehead<br/>
and rocks him a step back. The man’s rupture smokes <br/>
like an ashtray holding three lit cigarettes.<br/>
He hops off, totally pumped, screaming “Rock!”</p>

<p>The next in line is an older woman, church-going, country,<br/>
in a clean, faded dress. She’s alarmed at the prior man’s violence<br/>
but trusts her vision will align with her more gentle nature. <br/>
She sits, hikes her dress to show the rupture on her inner-knee. <br/>
Trump’s handlers hold her leg up as he kneels down<br/>
on a red velvet footstool and maneuvers his chin ballsack<br/>
onto the wound. She tilts her chin up and closes her eyes. <br/>
He has to smush his face on her thigh to get it in there<br/>
and when he does Trump’s top hair lifts up, <br/>
just two tentative inches, and flutters <br/>
as if in a steady breeze off the sea. Strings<br/>
rise softly in her mind. For her the joining is cool air<br/>
over ice-cold water. A guitar comes in like a warm blanket. </p>

<p><em>An adaptation of Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA”</em>  </p>

<p>Trump’s returned all the factories, now they’re where they should be.<br/>
He walled in the thieving Mexicans, now of their filth we’re free.<br/>
If you’re a liberal protester, then you’ve been made to pay.<br/>
He sent you to Guantanamo to make you bless the U.S.A. </p>

<p>Trump released the carpet bombs, he let the nukes go free.<br/>
Watch out in the Middle East! You’re gonna to pay your fee. <br/>
He’s rid our home of enemies, restored our native way.<br/>
He’s banished all the PC speech, freedom for the U.S.A.!</p>

<p>From the blondes of Minnesota, to the toughs of Tennessee, <br/>
all the true of Texas, great sea to best sea, </p>

<p>from Detroit down to Houston, and New York to LA, <br/>
pride’s enforced in each American heart, <br/>
don’t be weak--stand and say: </p>

<p>Trump's made our women proper now, returned their mystery.<br/>
He's hid disgusting menstruation, it makes a ten a three. <br/>
The poor can’t take our country now, not the blacks not the gays.<br/>
We can live our life again, because you know we earned our way. </p>

<p>We’re proud to be from America, where those like us are free. <br/>
Praise all the poor troops who died, never pointlessly. <br/>
We have restored the gloried past, put our greatness on display.<br/>
And now again we love this land, since Trump blessed the U.S.A.!!!!</p>

<p>Holding her asscheek in one hand and her ankle <br/>
in the other, Trump gently pushes her leg away.<br/>
He rises slowly, short of breath. She steps back<br/>
a few steps, pauses, then rushes back to him<br/>
falling to her knees on his footstool. Trump’s <br/>
bodyguards move in but he stops them.  </p>
 
<p>Through her tears she watches a caustic tear roll down <br/>
a reddish rut well-worn into Trump’s right cheek. </p>

<p>She rises, face expressionless, calm. Trump nods<br/>
to her and she walks off, wary, like walking’s new,<br/>
repeating "those like us, those like us" in a whisper.</p>

<p>The next in line steps up. His rupture <br/>
is in his mouth, like a huge white coldsore <br/>
on his inside cheek. Trump turns to face him, alert. <br/>
His chin ballsack does a little excited wiggle. </p> 

<p>The man walks forward, but Trump stops him, turns<br/>
to address the gathered crowd. </p>

<p>He intones,  “behold, dear viewers, you’re not alone.  <br/>
Raise your eyes. Watch my dreams and they are yours.” <br/>
Trump turns back, takes the man’s hand and pulls him<br/>
into an elegant half-spin before bringin him back up. <br/>
The man lowers his head, twisting his face upward, <br/>
and opens his mouth wide like a little baby bird. <br/>
