<p>“This isn't golf, this is a blisterin' assault,<br>
Those are your wounds, this is the salt”<br>
<img src="images/11.jpg" class="illustration"></img>
<p style="text-align: center;">Not just the history to reveal,<br>
but the hoax it keeps concealed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h4 style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>The Museum of American Greatness</b></h4>

<p>Welcome to the entrance to the gate.<br>
Everything that came before’s too late. </p>

<p>A change has occurred, but it’s not new. <br>
You don’t know what you once knew.</p>

<p>Below the neck scrotum was a flower,<br>
so hungry it’s the concept of devour. </p>

<p>Comes up through the neck from below—<br>
the gut’s the real brain, the real show.</p>

<p>The scrotum withered off, like designed.<br>
Everyone that loves him stays resigned.</p>

<p>They all knew this change would come.<br>
You’re not from where they’re from. </p>

<p>~</p>

<p>Twenty old conservative white guys watch. <br>
Like the late Roman Senate: rotten, too wise. </p>

<p>Balled wires unfurl from the flower’s bubbling rot,<br>
sniffing eagerly for scared power, that orphaned tot. </p>

<img src="images/12.jpg" class="illustration">
    
<h4 style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>“Teach American Exceptionalism”</b></h4>
    
<p>America’s got a death cult not alive enough to know it. <br>
Dissonance so exceptional, it must be taught—rises<br>
like vapour from water where an ice sheet was: <br>
a mask for failure only visible to the wearer. </p>

<p>Avoidable death, new great altar to life. Rot <br>
with the beauty of a field of wild flowers—<br>
if you are willing enough to be exceptional. </p>
        
<p>“Don’t let the virus domina—” No, you must fear <br>
with him now: a life not dominated completely. </p>

<p>No longer your co-producer, freer of your fucks.<br>
Now, together, free all fucks or fail most freely. </p>
 
<p>54 million American cowards fill a stadium, jostling, <br>
shaking rolled-up ballots, now stabbing their eyes bluntly </p>

<p>with the ballots. It hurts, causes minor damage and <br>
some blindness. Constant as a comment thread. Thud.</p>

<p>~</p>

<p>prez salt-in-wound is damn near mined dry.<br>
Fed what fear can, given all. Agent of death, <br>
aided and abetted by the party of life. Cornered <br>
animal—a dangerous thing. Might kill then die. </p>


<img src="images/13.jpg" class="illustration">

<h4 style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>The Last Hoax </b></h4>
    
<p>Gentle Monster mourns the little pile of salt<br>
that was once the President of the United States.<br>
Sweeps it into an open palm carefully, adds it<br>
to the slow-cooking stew of everything mourned. </p>

<p>Gentle Monster, born this morning mushroom-like<br>
from a contradiction device, like a soothing explosion,<br>
fueled by bullshit, our recklessness, all negligence,<br>
“this pending cosmic elegy.” <br>
All that filled the streets<br>
with raging refusal Gentle Monster gathers, <br>
adds to the simmering stew, sadness sealed in pride,<br>
opening in low, constant heat on the daylong walk<br>
to a well of common language.</p>

<p>~</p>

<p>Gentle Monster arrives to that well and sets the pot<br>
aside to cool. Looks to the setting sun in praise.</p>

<p>When dark, upturns the pot above the now-trembling well <br>
All empties upward and ascends. Gentle Monster walks away, <br>
most carefreely. Cellphone video of it all streams widely.</p>

<p>The court jesters of the king clown argue <br>
what Gentle Monster did was a hoax. <br>
Was. Love only hoaxes a too human world. <br>
Gently, monstrously, the very best we can do. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b><u>END</u></b></p>

<p>Note: A hoax exists not in the creation,<br>
but in the reception. The meaning of a hoax<br>
is reliant on how its intent and its reception<br>
line up. You must interpret your way into being<br>
the butt of the joke, or not. Either way, it’s on you. </p>
